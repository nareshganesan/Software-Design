This Project is the final version of the sample project which I implemented using java design patterns.
I would like to add many features in course of time. 

The Application is like a miniature of a Ecommerce website 

main modules or business in the application are :

Admin 
Customer
Supplier

The whole application is built on using a model view control architecture.

The Business logic for the individual modules are implemented using Strategy design, so the addition of new feature is simple.
The Data layer is built using Abstract Factory pattern for supporting different Databases (MySQL,SQL Server, Oracle).
